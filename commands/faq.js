			Experience *(XP)* is distributed when bets are closed.
				- A winning bet is worth 50 XP
				 - A losing bet is 20.\n
				Levels are incorporated into the system to establish a structured progression system that goes beyond mere financial gains.
				This system not only provides a clear measure of who the top performers are but also facilitates rewarding *(prizes, giveaway entries, etc)* the top betters at the end of each season.
				Everyone starts at level 0, and the max level is 100.
				
			## **__Tiers__**
			Tiers are ranks that you receive as you level up.
			Here is the list of tiers and their level ranges:
		    Bronze: 0-15
			Silver: 15-30
			Gold: 30-50
			Emerald: 50-75
			Diamond: 75-100
			
			# **__Parlays__**
			*TBD*
